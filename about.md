My Java notes jotted down from some of the best books in Java __(SCJP Java, Thinking in Java,
Effective Java, Java Puzzlers and of course JLS)__ and published as a blog with the help of awesome
__Github's Jekyll__.

It attempts to demystify some of the most misunderstood concepts in **Java** which may confound
even many experienced java programmers.

This blog may not be the best for new learners (greenhorns) but may be worth a read for others who
can **contribute** too by simply sending in a pull request.
