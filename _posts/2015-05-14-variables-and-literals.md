title: Variables and Literals
---

Variables are devices that are used to store data, such as a number, or a string of character data so that we can 
manipulate them later in our program. Variables can be broadly classified in to 4 types in Java:

1. __Class__ variables (static, declared in a class).
2. __Instance__ variables (non-static, declared in a class).
3. __Local__ variables (declared inside a method).
4. __Block__ variables (variables in static blocks, for-loop blocks etc).

Instance variables and objects reside in heap whereas local variables reside in stack. Consider the below program:

{% highlight java linenos %}
class Collar {
}

class Dog {
    Collar c; // instance variable
    String name; // instance variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d; // local variable: d
        d = new Dog();
        d.go(d);
    }

    void go(Dog dog) { // local variable: dog
        c = new Collar();
        dog.setName("Aiko");
    }

    void setName(String dogName) { // local var: dogName
        name = dogName;
        // do more stuff
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

For the above program, the instance variables, objects and local variables will be stored in memory as shown in the 
figure below:

### Literal Values for All Primitive Types

__Literals__ are nothing but values that a particular data type can hold. A __primitive literal__ is merely a source 
code representation of the primitive data types, in other words, an integer, floating-point number, boolean, or 
character etc. that you type in while writing code. The following are examples of primitive literals:

{% highlight java %}
127          // byte literal
376          // short literal
4290         // int literal
58L          // long literal
2546.343f    // float literal
2546789.343  // double literal
'b'          // char literal
false        // boolean literal
{% endhighlight %}

#### Integer Literals

There are four ways to represent integer numbers in the Java language: decimal (base 10), octal (base 8),
hexadecimal (base 16), and from Java 7, binary (base 2).
 
One more new feature introduced in Java 7 was __numeric literals with underscores (_) characters__. This was introduced
to increase readability. See below:

{% highlight java %}
int pre7 = 1000000;     // pre Java 7 â€“ we hope it's a million
int with7 = 1_000_000;  // much clearer!
{% endhighlight %}

But you must keep in mind the below gotchas:
{% highlight java %}
int i1 = _1_000_000; // illegal, can't begin with an "_" 
int i2 = 10_0000_0;  // legal, but confusing
{% endhighlight %}

NOTE: You can use the underscore character for any of the numeric types (including doubles and floats), but for
doubles and floats, you CANNOT add an underscore character directly next to the decimal point.

**Decimal Literals**

These are numbers with a radix of 10 which we use most commonly. They do not need prefix of any kind and are initialized
as below:

{% highlight java %}
int length = 343; // 343 is the literal
{% endhighlight %}

**Binary Literals**

From Java 7, you can initialize variables holding binary literals. But they must start with either `0B` or `0b`, as shown 
below:

{% highlight java %}
int b1 = 0B101010;   // set b1 to binary 101010 (decimal 42)
int b2 = 0b00011;    // set b2 to binary 11 (decimal 3)
{% endhighlight %}

**Octal Literals**

Octal integers use only the digits 0 to 7. They have a radix of 8. In Java, you represent an integer in octal form by 
placing a zero in front of the number, as follows:

{% highlight java %}
int six = 06;     // equal to decimal 6
int seven = 07;   // equal to decimal 7
int eight = 010;  // equal to decimal 8
int nine = 011;   // equal to decimal 9
{% endhighlight %}

You can have up to 21 digits in an octal number, not including the leading zero. This is because no mater what number
system you use, the range of values that an `int` can hold is always between $$ -2^{31} $$ to $$ +2^{31}-1 $$.

**Hexadecimal Literals**

Hexadecimal (hex for short) numbers are constructed using 16 distinct symbols. They have a radix of 16. Counting from 
0 through 15 in hex looks like this:

{% highlight java %}
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f
{% endhighlight %}

Java accepts uppercase or lowercase letters for the extra digits _(one of the few places Java is not case-sensitive)_.
You represent an integer in hexadecimal form by placing a `0x` in front of the number, as follows:

{% highlight java %}
int x = 0X0001;     // equals to decimal 1
int y = 0x7fffffff; // equals to decimal 2147483647
int z = 0xDeadCafe; // equals to decimal -559035650
{% endhighlight %}

All four integer literals (binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal) are defined as `int` by default, but they may also
be specified as `long` by placing a suffix of `L` or `l` after the number:

{% highlight java %}
long jo = 110599L;
long so = 0xFFFFl;  // Note the lowercase 'l'
{% endhighlight %}

#### Floating-point Literals

Floating-point numbers are defined as a number, a decimal symbol, and more numbers representing the fraction. For
example,

{% highlight java %}
double d = 11301874.9881024;
{% endhighlight %}

By default, floating-point literals are defined as `double` (64 bits) so if you want to assign a floating-point literal
to a variable of type `float` (32 bits), you must attach the suffix `F` or `f` to the number. So, the below code 
generates a compiler error:

{% highlight java %}
float f = 23.467890;    // Compiler error, possible loss
                        // of precision
{% endhighlight %}

This happens because we're trying to fit a larger number (64 bits) into a (potentially) less precise "container" 
(32 bits).

Now as by default floating-point literals are of type `double`, it is optional to attach a suffix of `D` or `d` when you
want to assign it to a variable of type `double`. For example,

{% highlight java %}
double d = 110599.995011D; // Optional, not required
double  g = 987.897;       // No 'D' suffix, but OK because the
                           // literal is a double by default
{% endhighlight %}

#### Boolean Literals

Boolean literals can be either `true` or `false`. In C (and some other languages) it is common to use numbers to 
represent true or false, but this will not work in Java. For example,

{% highlight java %}
boolean t = true;  // Legal
boolean  f = 0;    // Compiler error!
int x = 1;  if (x) { } // Compiler error!
{% endhighlight %}

#### Character Literals

A char literal is represented by a single character in __single quotes__: 

{% highlight java %}
char a = 'a';
char b = '@';
{% endhighlight %}

You can also assign unicode value to a `char` variable, like:

{% highlight java %}
char letterN = '\u004E'; // The letter 'N'
{% endhighlight %}

Note, characters are nothing but __16-bit unsigned integers__. So, you can assign a number literal, assuming it will fit 
into the unsigned 16-bit range (0 to 65535) to a `char` variable. For example, the following are all __legal__:

{% highlight java %}
char a = 0x892;        // hexadecimal literal
char b = 982;          // int literal
char c = (char)70000;  // The cast is required; 70000 is
                       // out of char range
char d = (char) -98;   // Ridiculous, but legal
{% endhighlight %}

And the following are __not legal__ and produce compiler errors:

{% highlight java %}
char e = -29;    // Possible loss of precision; needs a cast
char f = 70000;  // Possible loss of precision; needs a cast
{% endhighlight %}

#### Literal values for Strings

You can create a `String` in Java in the following ways:

{% highlight java %}
String s = "tutorial";
String str = new String("Rahul roy");
String con = s + str; // concatenate 2 strings
{% endhighlight %}

Strings are __not primitives__ in Java but can be represented as literals, in other words, they can be typed directly
into code like:

{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Bill" + " Joy");
{% endhighlight %}

### Literal values for Non-Primitives

Variables are just bit holders, with a designated type. You can have an `int` holder, a `double` holder, a `long` holder,
and even a `String[]` holder. This holder is assigned a bunch of bits representing the value. For primitives, the bits 
represent __a numeric value__ but for non-primitives, these bits represent __a way to get to the object__. 

For example, a `byte` with a value of `6` means that the bit pattern in the variable (the `byte` holder) is `00000110`,
representing the 8 bits. But what happens in case of non-primitives, for example, `Button b = new Button();`, what's 
inside the `Button` holder `b`? Is it the Button object? No! A variable referring to an object is just a reference 
variable. A __reference variable__ bit holder contains __bits representing a way to get to the object__. We don't know 
what the format is. The way in which object references are stored is virtual-machine specific (it's a pointer to 
something, we just don't know what that something really is). All we can say for sure is that the variable's value is 
not the object, but rather a value representing a specific object on the heap. Or `null`. When it is `null`, i.e, 
`Button b = null;` you can say that the reference variable `b` is not referring to any object.

There is one important concept to understand here, i.e, a reference variable can refer to any object that is a 
__subclass__ of the declared reference variable type but not a __superclass__. Let's see why.

{% highlight java linenos%}
class Foo {
    public void doFooStuff() { }
}
class Bar extends Foo {
    public void doBarStuff() { }
}
class Test {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
    Foo reallyABar = new Bar();  // Legal because Bar is a
                                 // subclass of Foo
    Bar reallyAFoo = new Foo();  // Compiler error! Foo is not a
                                 // subclass of Bar
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In line 11, `reallyAFoo` is a `Bar` reference variable (child) so someone would call `reallyAFoo.doBarStuff()` but the
reference variable actually holds a `Foo` object (parent) which doesn't have a `doBarStuff()` method. So, the compiler 
prevents this and gives a `Incompatible types` error.

In other words, a child class is nothing but the parent class with additional properties. So there is no issue in line 9,
where a `Foo` reference variable (parent) is holding a `Bar` object (child). Because everything a `Foo` object can do, 
can also be done by a `Bar` object.

### Casting

__Casting__ is a way of converting literal values/objects from one type to another. When the type of variable is 
__different__ from the type of literal/object it's holding/referring, you may require __casting__. 

Casting can be done by the compiler _(implicit cast)_ or by you _(explicit cast)_. Typically, an implicit cast happens 
when you're doing a __widening conversion__, in other words, putting a smaller thing (say, a byte) into a bigger container 
(such as an int). But when you try to put a large value into a small container (referred to as __narrowing__), you should 
do an explicit cast, where you tell the compiler that you're aware of the danger and accept full responsibility. Let's
for example consider the below program:

{% highlight java linenos %}
class Casting {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        long a = 100;   // literal '100' is implicitly an 'int' 
                        //but the compiler does an implicit cast
        int b = (int) 10.23;    // literal '10.23' is implicitly a 'double'
                                // so we require an explicit cast
        int x = 3957.229;   // illegal, can't store a large value in a 
                            // small container without explicit cast
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### There are some rules which you must be aware of:

* The result of an expression involving anything int-sized or smaller is always an `int`, so we must explicitly cast 
it. Check this out:

{% highlight java %}
byte a = 3;     // No problem, 3 fits in a byte
byte b = 8;     // No problem, 8 fits in a byte
byte c = a + b; // Should be no problem, sum of the two bytes
                // fits in a byte
{% endhighlight %}

The last line won't compile! You'll get an error like this:

{% highlight java %}
TestBytes.java:5: possible loss of precision
found   : int
required: byte
byte c = a + b;
           ^ 
{% endhighlight %}

Doing an explicit cast like:

{% highlight java %}
byte c = (byte) (a + b);
{% endhighlight %}

solves the issue.

* In case of compound assignment operators, explicit cast isn't required. The below code compiles just fine:

{% highlight java %}
byte b = 3;
b += 7; // No problem - adds 7 to b (result is 10)
{% endhighlight %}

#### What happens when you cast a large value to store it in a small container

When you do a explicit cast, the compiler just keeps __the number of bits (from right)__ that the variable type can hold 
and strips off the rest. Consider the below program to understand better:

{% highlight java linenos %}
class Casting {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int i = 7;
        byte b = (byte) i;
        System.out.println("The 1st byte is " + b); // prints 7
        // now let's see another example
        int i = 128;
        byte b = (byte) i;
        System.out.println("The 2nd byte is " + b); // prints -128
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

So, in line 4, `i` is `7` i.e, `00000000000000000000000000000111` (32 bits) and when we do a explicit cast, the compiler
just stores `00000111` (8 bits) in variable `b` (as `byte` can hold only 8 bits) which is also `7`. Therefore, it prints
`7`. But in line 8, `i` is `128` i.e, `00000000000000000000000010000000` and after stripping off the extra bits we are
left with `10000000` which is not `128` as the 1st bit is the sign bit. So, after computing the 2's compliment of it we 
get `-128` as the result.

### Scope

Scope refers to the __lifetime and accessibility of a variable__. In simple words, how long will the variable be hanging
around so that they can be used by other parts of the program. Different types of variables have different scope.

1. __Class or static__ variables have the longest scope. They are created when the class is loaded, and they survive as
long as the class stays loaded in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
2. __Instance or non-static__ variables are the next most long-lived. They are created when a new instance is created, 
and they live until the instance is removed.
3. __Local__ variables are next. They live as long as their method remains on the stack. As we'll soon see, however, 
local variables can be alive and still be "out of scope".
4. __Block__ variables live only as long as the code block is executing.

Below program shows all types of variables and explains their scopes too. Please refer to the comments to understand which
are __in scope__ and which are __out of scope__.

{% highlight java linenos %}
class Scope {
    static int s = 343; // static variable
    int x; // instance variable

    { // initialization block
        x = 7;
        int x2 = 5; // block variable
    }

    Scope() { // constructor
        x += 8;
        int x3 = 6;
    }

    void doStuff() { // method
        int y = 0; // local variable
        for (int z = 0; z < 4; z++) { // 'for' code block
            y += z + x;
        }
        z++; // compiler error (out of scope)
        x2++; // compiler error (out of scope)   
    }

    public static void main(String[] a) {
        x++; // compiler error! 'x' is instance variable, so 
             // we need an object to access it
        x2++; x3++; // compiler error! block variables scope
                    // is only inside the block in which they
                    // are declared
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Variable Initialization

Java gives us the option of initializing a declared variable or leaving it uninitialized. When we attempt to use 
the uninitialized variable, we can get different behavior depending on __what type of variable or array we are dealing
with (primitives or objects)__. The behavior also depends on __the level (scope) at which we are declaring our 
variable__.

#### Default values for Instance variables (Primitive and Non-primitive):

Variable Type | Default Value
--------------|----------------
`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` | `0`
`float`, `double` | `0.0`
`boolean` | `false`
`char` | `'\u0000'`
Object reference | `null` (not referencing any object)

Therefore, for the below program:

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class Book {
    private String title;       // instance reference variable
    private int noOfPages;      // instance primitive variable
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    public int getNoOfPages() {
            return noOfPages;
    }
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Book b = new Book();
        System.out.println("The title is " + b.getTitle());
        System.out.println("No. of pages are " + b.getNoOfPages());
    } 
}
{% endhighlight %}

The output will be:
`The title is null`
`No. of pages are 0`

__NOTE:__ `null` is not the same as an empty `String ("")`. A `null` value means the reference variable is not referring
to any object on the heap.

#### Array Instance Variable

An array is an object, thus, an array instance variable that's declared but not explicitly initialized will have a value
of __`null`__, just as any other object reference instance variable. But if the array is initialized, all array elements
are given their default values, the same default values that elements of that type get when they're instance variables. 
In short, __Array elements are always, always, always given default values, regardless of where the array itself 
is declared or instantiated__.
   
Variable Type | Default Value
--------------|----------------
Array (uninitialized) | `null`
Array (initialized) | Default values of their respective types as discussed above

#### Default values for Local (also called Stack or Automatic) variables (Primitive and Non-primitive):

Local variables, including primitives, always, always, always must be initialized before you attempt to use them 
(though not necessarily on the same line of code). Java does not give local variables a default value, you must 
explicitly initialize them with a value.
